# Strategy

> Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Assumption
Imagine  you are handling 2 numbers in different ways, such as add, mutiple, substract and devide
you can build a handler object to store a strategy object, and do the maths by the strategy object
